Before your pull request is reviewed and merged, please ensure that:

* [ ] there are no linting errors -- `npm run lint`, from the root of the n4m-examples repository, not within your example folder
* [ ] your example is well documentedâ€”make sure there is a `README.md` in your example folder
* [ ] your example has been added to the root `README.md` file

Thank you!
